# We are going to connect to MySQL, and pull data from the table 'checkins' into a
# Kafka topic called 'checkins'

# Give the configuration a name
name=tutorial-source-read-checkins

# Specify the JDBC connector
connector.class=io.confluent.connect.jdbc.JdbcSourceConnector

# We're only reading in one table, so set the maximum number of tasks accordingly
tasks.max=1

# Specify where the server is, and the database, username and password
connection.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/tutorial?user=kafkauser&password=kafka

# We want to use the 'incrementing' mode
mode=incrementing
incrementing.column.name=id

# Use the whitelist feature to specify only the 'checkins' table
table.whitelist=checkins

# It's good practice to use a prefix so that you can keep track when you have
# many topics, coming from many different places. We'll use 'tutorial-'
topic.prefix=tutorial-
